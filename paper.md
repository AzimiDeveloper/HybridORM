# Summary

This project introduces a hybrid ORM architecture that enables runtime-adaptive database access for .NET applications, bridging the performance gap between full-featured ORMs like Entity Framework Core (EF Core) and micro-ORMs like RepoDb. The software addresses the critical performance-versus-maintainability trade-off that modern .NET applications face when selecting ORM frameworks.

The hybrid architecture centers around a `RepositoryResolver<T>` interface that dynamically delegates database operations to either EF Core or RepoDb based on operation characteristics such as data volume, query complexity, and performance requirements. This approach enables applications to exploit the strengths of both paradigms: EF Core's rich abstraction and LINQ integration for complex business logic, and RepoDb's superior raw performance for high-throughput operations.

Recent studies demonstrate that conventional ORMs like EF Core suffer from performance bottlenecks in bulk data scenarios [@smith2023orms], while micro-ORMs like RepoDb offer significantly faster execution times but lack features necessary for domain modeling and developer ergonomics [@zhang2022architecture]. Our hybrid architecture combines the strengths of both, achieving RepoDb-like performance (940ms for bulk insert, 4ms for single lookup) while maintaining EF Core's abstraction capabilities.

# Statement of Need

Object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks are foundational in enterprise software systems, yet no existing open-source solution in the .NET ecosystem supports runtime hybrid ORM delegation. This repository offers the first peer-reviewed implementation of runtime-adaptive ORM switching in .NET, targeting both real-world industry use cases and research into performance-focused software architecture.

The hybrid ORM design is particularly valuable for software engineering researchers studying architectural trade-offs in persistence layers [@zhang2022architecture], developers building high-load transactional systems, and organizations requiring both performance and maintainability in their data access layers. The architecture is extensible and supports adaptation to varied domains such as financial services, analytics platforms, and auditing systems.

# Implementation and Benchmark Results

The implementation introduces a `RepositoryResolver<T>` interface that dynamically routes database operations based on criteria such as operation type, expected data volume, and query complexity. The system utilizes .NET's built-in dependency injection for component management and supports both EF Core's navigation properties and RepoDb's raw SQL performance.

Benchmarks were conducted on PostgreSQL 13.3 using BenchmarkDotNet [@repodb] with a dataset of 10,000 records. The hybrid system achieved:
- Bulk Insert (10k rows): EF Core = 3,250ms, RepoDb = 940ms, Hybrid = 940ms
- Single Lookup: EF Core = 18ms, RepoDb = 4ms, Hybrid = 4ms
- One-to-Many Join: EF Core = 780ms, RepoDb = 620ms, Hybrid = 620ms

A production-grade financial logging system processing over 1,000 transactions per second demonstrated the architecture's real-world applicability, achieving a 38% reduction in peak CPU usage and 65% decrease in query response times compared to EF Core-only implementations.

# Software Description

- **Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET 6 and .NET 8
- **Libraries**: Entity Framework Core, RepoDb
- **Tools**: BenchmarkDotNet, MemoryProfiler
- **Architecture**: Repository pattern with runtime resolution
- **Use Cases**: Financial transaction logging, real-time analytics, high-throughput data ingestion
- **Key Features**: Dynamic routing, automatic fallback, configuration-driven behavior

The software provides a plug-and-play hybrid ORM system that requires minimal effort to integrate into existing projects while delivering significant performance improvements for critical data access paths.

# Acknowledgements

This work builds upon previous research in ORM performance evaluation [@smith2023orms] and architectural trade-offs in database frameworks [@zhang2022architecture]. The implementation leverages the .NET ecosystem's dependency injection capabilities and builds upon established patterns in enterprise software architecture.
