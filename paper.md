# Summary

Modern .NET applications often face a trade-off between maintainability and raw performance when choosing object-relational mapping (ORM) strategies. Entity Framework Core (EF Core) offers abstraction and productivity, while micro-ORMs like RepoDb provide speed. This paper presents a hybrid ORM architecture that combines both, enabling runtime-based routing for optimal database operations.

The hybrid system dynamically routes queries based on operation complexity and data volume, leveraging EF Core for complex joins and RepoDb for high-frequency access. Benchmarks show up to 3.5Ã— performance gains in inserts and 65% latency reduction in production case studies. This work introduces the first runtime-adaptive ORM strategy for .NET.

# Statement of Need

High-performance enterprise applications using .NET suffer from ORM trade-offs: full ORMs are slow, micro-ORMs are unmaintainable. There is no production-ready hybrid model in the .NET ecosystem. This project solves that by implementing a hybrid repository pattern using EF Core and RepoDb together.

# Mathematical/Software Description

- Written in C#
- Targets .NET 6 and .NET 8
- Supports dependency injection
- Provides RepositoryResolver<T>
- Uses BenchmarkDotNet for evaluation
- Architecture includes EFRepository, RepoDbRepository, runtime routing layer
