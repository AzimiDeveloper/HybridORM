This folder is intended to contain documentation and supplementary materials for the Hybrid ORM project.

## What Belongs Here?

You should include:
- Design diagrams (e.g., class diagrams, flowcharts, architecture overviews)
- Usage instructions (if not placed in README)
- Examples of integration with real-world systems
- Deployment notes
- API structure (if applicable)
- Anything relevant for users, reviewers, or contributors

## Important Notes

- Do **not** store non-source code like PDF articles inside `/src`.
- Documentation should be in English to support international contributors.
- Prefer Markdown (.md) or plain text (.txt) for maintainability.
