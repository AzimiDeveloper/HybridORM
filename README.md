# Hybrid ORM for High-Performance .NET Applications

## Overview

HybridORM is a runtime-adaptive ORM architecture for .NET that combines the abstraction and maintainability of Entity Framework Core with the raw performance of RepoDb. It dynamically switches between the two based on query complexity and performance demands.

This repository supports reproducible benchmarking and integration into high-throughput enterprise applications.
